  <div class="colorbox--red sans">
    <h2>Geometric</h2>
    <p>
      At their best, Geometric Sans are clear,
      objective, modern, universal;
      at their worst, cold, impersonal,
      boring. A classic Geometric Sans is
      like a beautifully designed airport:
      it’s impressive, modern and useful,
      but we have to think twice about
      whether or not we’d like to live there.

  <div class="colorbox--blue cambria">
    <h2>Transitional</h2>
    <p>
      At their best, transitional and modern
      faces seem strong, stylish, dynamic.
      At their worst, they seem neither here
      nor there — too conspicuous and baroque
      to be classic,
      too stodgy to be truly modern.
